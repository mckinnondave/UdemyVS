Declaring Structs

public struct RgbColor 
{
	public int Red;
	public int Green;
	public int Blue;
}

These are similar to Classes with some differences. Structs usually used for small, lightway concepts like this color group. 99% of the time, we would use classes though.


Arrays

Declaring:

To do this:
int number1
int number2
int number3

We can do this:
int[] numbers = new int[3]; // notice the new operator because we are allocating memory.

Accessing elements:

number[0] = 1;
number[1] = 2;
number[2] = 3;

or 

int[] numbers = new int[3] { 1, 2, 3 };
